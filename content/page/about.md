## A little about me


I am currently an engineer in the INRIA laboratory of Rennes in the [DiverSE team](https://www.diverse-team.fr/).

I work on two subjects at the moment:
- I am helping on the creation of a thesis subject related to openAPI about facilitating the co-evolution between the Requirements, the Code, and the Documentation.
- And I am also working on different subjects in relation to the [Software Heritage initiative](https://www.softwareheritage.org/).

Even tho I am an engineer, I hope to be starting a Phd in the Diverse Team in less than a year.

## My Studies

- Engineering Diploma: Software Engineering, ESIR school, Rennes; attained top class position.
- Bachelor's Degree: Computer science, Universit√© de Rennes 1 / ESIR School
- High school diploma in Engineering Sciences.
