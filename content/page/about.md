## A little about me

I am currently an engineer in the INRIA laboratory of Rennes in the [DiverSE team](https://www.diverse-team.fr/).

I work on two subjects at the moment:
- I am working on a subject related to OpenAPI. 
- And I am also working on different subjects related to the [Software Heritage initiative](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), and more precisely about [Enhancing Cybersecurity](https://www.softwareheritage.org/2023/04/07/enhancing-cybersecurity-through-swh/) through Software Heritage.


*Even tho I am an engineer, I hope to be starting a Phd in less than a year.*

## My Studies

- **Engineering Diploma**: Software Engineering, ESIR school, Rennes; attained top class position.
- **Bachelor's Degree**: Computer science, Universit√© de Rennes 1 / ESIR School
- **High school diploma**: Engineering Sciences.

## Areas of Interest

My main area of interest is of course *Software Engineering*, I am not focusing on any precise subject at the moment and I am still exploring the possibility that this field offers.
My attention is however drawn to cutting edge technologies and advancements, as well as new trends that change the way we work. Basically, how things evolve will determine what I will work on in the future.

Other than Software Engineering, I spend a lot of my spare time climbing (as you can see in the profile picture), as well as learning mandarin on my own. When I can, I like to read about philosophy, though I can never find enough time.
