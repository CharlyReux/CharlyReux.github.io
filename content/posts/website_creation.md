I had already made websites before, whether it was for school projects, internships or just for myself. 
I actually made 2 different portfolio websites before this one, both in vanilla JS, which I hosted on a server that I had. But those websites became quickly quite awful to maintain, so I was not updating them, and they became quickly outdated.

This time I wanted something more stable, so I decided to use Hugo and to host it via github.io. And so far, this solution appears to be quite convenient.

Hugo allow me to blog as well, and I am planning to post whenever I find something interesting to add in this website, probably about software related things, and possibly about any other topic that interest me.
