I had already made websites before, whether it was for school projects, internships or just for myself. 
I actually made 2 different portfolio websites before this one, both in vanilla JS, which I both hosted on a server that I had. But those website became quickly wuite awful to maintain so I was not updating them and they became quckly outdated.

This time I wanted something more stable, so I decided to use Hugo and to host it via github.io. And so far, this solution appears to be ubiquitous.
