*This is a draft, I don't know how you ended there*

The way we develop pieces of software always revolves around *Abstraction*, every application nowadays just consists of sucession of layers that stems from the electrical signal hardware all the way to the code that we write. Every layer uses the abstraction provided by the subsequent ones, and so on.
It always amazes me how complex but yet functioning are the software programs that we use today, but this complexity is a necessity if we want to keep building new and valuables solutions for our needs.

My point here is that we have kept evolving and increasing the abstraction from which we develop software, and with the latest advances in AI, and more precisely the advent of LLMs, I strongly believe that the abstraction will go to a whole other level. The same way not many people develop using Assembly nowadays, as early as five to ten years from now not many people we be developing using python, java or any sort of code for that matter.
Solutions we arrive that will allow us to create better software, faster and without having to deal with any bugs.

I think that one of the first steps will obviously be the use of natural language to create applications, without having to touch the code in any way. But what will really be interesting will be how we will create software in 15 to 50 years, (if we will even have to develop any by now). I think that after natural language we will use drawings and talking, basically any way that exists to express a need will be leveraged to create solutions, one could even think that software will automatically be created based on people's behaviors analyzed.

As it might be scary for many developers and software engineers. It is for me inevitable, and we should embrace it instead of fighting against it, all the while being careful about how we use it.
