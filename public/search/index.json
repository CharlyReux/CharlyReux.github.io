[{"content":"Note: this website is a work in progress, It is going to be updated in the near future\nHi! My name is charly, I am a software engineer in the INRIA laboratory in Rennes. I am passionated by programming and engineering in general. I love working on hard and complex projects and most of all, I love creating and exploring new ideas and new concepts.\nOn this website, you will find everything that there is to know about me, my projects, my passions, and how you can contact me. You might also find posts in the near future if I find time to make some in my spare time.\nSome links More about me Posts (soon) My Github I might add more links in the near future, all my contacts are available at the bottom of the page.\n","href":"/","title":"Home"},{"content":"This website is pretty new, so nothing so far in this section, but I will post things soon(hopefully).\n","href":"/posts/","title":"Posts"},{"content":"A little about me I am currently an engineer in the INRIA laboratory of Rennes in the DiverSE team.\nI work on two subjects at the moment:\nI am working on a subject related to OpenAPI. And I am also working on different subjects related to the Software Heritage initiative, and more precisely about Enhancing Cybersecurity through Software Heritage. Even tho I am an engineer, I hope to be starting a Phd in less than a year.\nMy Studies Engineering Diploma: Software Engineering, ESIR school, Rennes; attained top class position. Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s Degree: Computer science, Universit√© de Rennes 1 / ESIR School High school diploma: Engineering Sciences. Areas of Interest My main area of interest is of course Software Engineering, I am not focusing on any precise subject at the moment and I am still exploring the possibility that this field offers. My attention is however drawn to cutting edge technologies and advancements, as well as new trends that change the way we work. Basically, how things evolve will determine what I will work on in the future.\nOther than Software Engineering, I spend a lot of my spare time climbing (as you can see in the profile picture), as well as learning mandarin on my own. When I can, I like to read about philosophy, though I can never find enough time.\n","href":"/myself/","title":"Myself"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/charlyreux/","title":"CharlyReux"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/dev/","title":"Dev"},{"content":"I had already made websites before, whether it was for school projects, internships or just for myself. I actually made 2 different portfolio websites before this one, both in vanilla JS, which I both hosted on a server that I had. But those website became quickly quite awful to maintain so I was not updating them and they became quickly outdated.\nThis time I wanted something more stable, so I decided to use Hugo and to host it via github.io. And so far, this solution appears to be ubiquitous.\n","href":"/posts/making-a-website/","title":"Making my website"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/projects/","title":"Projects"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/website/","title":"Website"},{"content":"","href":"/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":""},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"}]
