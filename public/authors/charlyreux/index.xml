      <description>A little about me I am currently an engineer in the INRIA laboratory of Rennes in the DiverSE team.&#xA;I work on two subjects at the moment:&#xA;I am working on a subject related to OpenAPI. And I am also working on different subjects related to the Software Heritage initiative, and more precisely about Enhancing Cybersecurity through Software Heritage. Even tho I am an engineer, I hope to be starting a Phd in less than a year.</description>

      <description>I had already made websites before, whether it was for school projects, internships or just for myself. I actually made 2 different portfolio websites before this one, both in vanilla JS, which I both hosted on a server that I had. But those website became quickly quite awful to maintain so I was not updating them and they became quickly outdated.&#xA;This time I wanted something more stable, so I decided to use Hugo and to host it via github.</description>
