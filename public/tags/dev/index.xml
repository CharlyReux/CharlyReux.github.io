      <description>I had already made websites before, whether it was for school projects, internships or just for myself. I actually made 2 different portfolio websites before this one, both in vanilla JS, which I hosted on a server that I had. But those websites became quickly quite awful to maintain, so I was not updating them, and they became quickly outdated.
This time I wanted something more stable, so I decided to use Hugo and to host it via github.</description>
